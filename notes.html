        Designing a new portfolio is easy.
            <br> Committing your time and following through with that original concept,
            <br> that's the tricky part.</h2>

            <h3><p>I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2023. I haven't been working on this update, but I have been coming back to it ever few months. It's undergone countless iterations.</p>
<br>

            <p> Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change its game (think responsive design). This was more down to me taking my sweet time more than anything else.</p>
      <br>          
        <p>  Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a new portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing / coding elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some flourishes in the coming weeks and months .</p>
    <br>            
    <p>  In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while building out this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution. Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with building their first portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!</h3></p>
